# Hi, I'm Danial Hamzehlouy 👋

I'm focused on **Python** and **Bash Scripting**, diving into the world of automation and system tools. As a newcomer to GitHub, I'm excited to start documenting my projects and collaborating with the community!

## 🐍 My Current Focus: Scripting & Automation

* **Python:** Mastering core Python features for building utility scripts, focusing on readability and efficiency.
* **Bash/Shell Scripting:** Learning to automate repetitive system administration tasks and workflow management from the command line.
* **Version Control:** Actively practicing **Git** workflows (cloning, committing, branching) to manage projects effectively.

## 🎯 My Near-Term Goal

My main goal right now is to build a practical set of scripts—one Python-based and one Bash-based—to automate file organization or system health checks on my local machine.

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

I'm always looking to learn and connect with others in the scripting and DevOps space.
